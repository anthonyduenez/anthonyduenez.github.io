            Process management plays a significant role in operating systems. 
            This does the multitasking, which is managing several applications 
            that are operating simultaneously. The OS is in charge of starting, 
            planning, and stopping processes while making sure that each one receives 
            an equitable amount of CPU time. grasp how operating systems preserve responsiveness 
            and performance requires a grasp of concepts like processes, threads, context switching, 
            and scheduling algorithms.
