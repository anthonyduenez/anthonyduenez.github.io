            Operating Systems are a fundamental part of computer science, acting
            as the bridge between computer hardware and users or applications.
            An operating system (OS) provides services that enable software programs
            to function effectively while managing hardware resources such the CPU, 
            memory, and storage. Users would have to communicate directly with 
            hardware in the absence of an operating system, which would be difficult
            and unfeasible. Popular operating systems that are tailored to various 
            device types and user requirements include Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, 
            and iOS.
